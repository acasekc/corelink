# About the client
Soulis Auctions is a Kansas City, Missouri-based auction house specializing in fine art and antiques. As a regional business with a global reach, they conduct live auctions featuring high-quality items, supported by online bidding platforms, telephone bidding, and in-person attendance. Services include professional photography, appraisals, in-house shipping, and catered events during auctions. The company emphasizes factual, advocate-driven auctioneering to maximize seller returns.
## Challenge
The [original website](https://old.soulisauctions.com) was an outdated custom-built platform that had been in use for many years. It featured a dated design with basic elements like a simple headline, a promotional quote from the Kansas City Star about record-breaking auctions, limited upcoming auction announcements, and an email signup link. The layout felt static and text-heavy, lacking modern visual appeal, high-quality imagery integration, intuitive navigation, or easy content management tools. Updating auction listings, adding blog content, or showcasing detailed lots was cumbersome, which hindered user engagement for buyers and sellers. The site also showed signs of being non-responsive or less optimized for modern devices and search engines, potentially limiting visibility and traffic.
## Solution
A completely [new website](https://soulisauctions.com) was developed to replace the old platform. The focus was on creating a clean, modern, and functional design that is easy to manage without requiring extensive technical expertise.
Key improvements and features include:

Upcoming Auctions Section — Dynamic previews of events (e.g., the Annual Winter Art Auction or Late Winter Auction), with detailed listings, high-resolution images, and clear calls-to-action for bidding and results.
Blog Integration — A dedicated "READ JOURNAL" section for regular posts, auction previews, and updates (e.g., recent entries from December 2025 highlighting upcoming sales like the 20th Annual Between-the-Holidays Auction), enabling quick and frequent content additions.
Resource Pages — Comprehensive artist indexes, exceptional lots from past sales, and useful links for buyers and consignors.
User Engagement Tools — Prominent newsletter signup form, multiple testimonials praising photography quality, staff service, and results, plus references to various bidding platforms (online, phone, in-person).
SEO Enhancements — On-page optimizations including improved meta tags, structured content for better search engine crawling, keyword-rich descriptions for auctions/artists/lots, faster load times, and mobile-friendly design to boost organic visibility and rankings.
Google Analytics Integration — Full implementation to track user behavior, traffic sources, popular pages (e.g., upcoming auctions and artist indexes), conversion events like newsletter signups, and overall site performance for data-driven future improvements.

The new site supports high-quality professional imagery, separate detailed lot listings, seamless navigation, and a responsive layout that works well on desktops and mobiles. Most links from the old site now redirect smoothly to the corresponding pages on the new platform, preserving legacy traffic while providing a vastly improved experience.
