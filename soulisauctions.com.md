#Case Study: Modernizing the Soulis Auctions Website
##Client Overview
Soulis Auctions is a Kansas City, Missouri-based auction house specializing in fine art and antiques. As a regional business with a global reach, they conduct live auctions featuring high-quality items, supported by online bidding platforms, telephone bidding, and in-person attendance. Services include professional photography, appraisals, in-house shipping, and catered events during auctions. The company emphasizes factual, advocate-driven auctioneering to maximize seller returns.
##Challenge
The original website was an outdated custom-built platform that had been in use for many years. It lacked modern features, making it challenging to update content, manage auction listings, or integrate new technologies like enhanced online bidding. This resulted in a site that was not user-friendly for either administrators or visitors, potentially limiting engagement from buyers and sellers.
##Solution
A new website was developed at https://soulisauctions.com/ to address these issues. The focus was on creating a clean, functional design that is easy to manage without requiring extensive technical expertise. Key features include:

Upcoming Auctions Section: Previews of events like the "Annual Winter Art Auction", with detailed listings and images.
Blog Integration: Regular posts for auction previews and updates, allowing quick content additions.
Resource Pages: Artist indexes, exceptional lots from past sales, and useful links for users.
User Engagement Tools: Newsletter signup, testimonials, and references to multiple bidding platforms.
The site supports high-quality imagery, separate lot listings, and seamless navigation, making it straightforward for the team to add new auctions, blogs, or resources.

###Results
The updated website provides a more accessible and manageable platform for Soulis Auctions. Administrators can easily update content, while users benefit from improved functionality, such as better searchability of artists and lots, and enhanced online interaction. This modernization helps maintain the company's reputation as a tech-savvy auction house, aligning with their history of adopting internet bidding since the late 1990s. Overall, the transition from the old custom site to this easy-to-manage version supports ongoing business operations without unnecessary complexity.
