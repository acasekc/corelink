Dustie's Delights: From Home Kitchen to Thriving Online Bakery
Dustie, a passionate young entrepreneur with a knack for baking irresistible cookies and sweet breads, dreamed of turning her homemade treats into a full-fledged business. Starting small from her home kitchen, she needed a professional online presence to reach customers beyond local markets—but as a startup, she required an affordable, easy-to-manage solution that could grow with her.
The Challenge
Dustie approached CoreLink Development with a clear vision: sell her signature chocolate chip cookies, artisanal banana breads, cinnamon rolls, and custom orders directly to customers. She wanted a site that handled everything—from product listings and secure payments to shipping calculations and tax management—without needing constant technical help. Flexibility was key: support for Stripe and PayPal integrations, plus cash-on-delivery options for local pickups.
Our Solution
At CoreLink, we built Dustie's Delights a fully custom e-commerce website tailored to her needs. Using modern, scalable technologies, we created an intuitive platform where Dustie can independently manage her entire store:

Product Management — Easy uploading of photos, descriptions, variants (e.g., dozen packs or gluten-free options), and inventory tracking.
Custom Quotes — A built-in form for personalized orders, like wedding cookie favors or bulk sweet bread requests.
Flexible Payments — Seamless integration with Stripe and PayPal for secure online transactions, alongside COD for convenience.
Shipping & Taxes — Automated rate calculations based on location, with full control over rules and zones.
User-Friendly Dashboard — Dustie handles customers, orders, and site updates herself—no coding required.

The result? A beautiful, mobile-responsive site that showcases her baked goods with mouthwatering galleries and smooth checkout flows.

Results & Impact
Since launch, Dustie's Delights has seen steady growth: quicker order processing, happier customers with seamless shopping experiences, and the freedom for Dustie to focus on baking rather than backend hassles. The site's scalability means she's ready for expansion—whether adding new products or shipping nationwide.
